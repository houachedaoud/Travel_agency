## Guide:
Important resources for this project:
### Server:
I personally used Tomcat server version 10.1.4 to exeute the project but i think any other web server would work just fine.
### Database:
I made this project based on oracle Databse 11g version, it's fine to change to mySql or mongoDB database just don't forget to change the connection.java
file content to whatever suits your database.
### Libraries:
In order for this project to work proparly you need to import some jar files which are: <br>
:point_right: oracle 11g version connector named ojdbc6_g.jar <br>
:point_right: since the project is using jstl technology to send values to the client side or jsp files you have to upload two jstl jars called jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl-2.0.0.jar and jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl-api-2.0.0.jar
